vowels Function
The vowels function takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels in the string. The function is case-insensitive and considers only the vowels 'aeiou'.


Test Class

The Test class includes several unit tests to ensure the correct functionality of the vowels function.

test_vowels_function(self): Verifies that vowels is a function.

test_vowels(self): Checks if the function returns the correct count of vowels for a string containing lowercase vowels.

test2(self): Tests the function with a string containing capitalized vowels, ensuring that it is case-insensitive.

test3(self): Validates the function's behavior with a string containing all the lowercase letters of the alphabet.

test4(self): Tests the function with a string that contains no vowels, ensuring it returns 0.
